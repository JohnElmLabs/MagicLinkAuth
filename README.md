# MagicLink Authentication

This repository demonstrates how to extend `mix phx.gen.auth`'s default capabilities by adding "magic link" authentication. That is, one-time sign-in links delivered to your email.

Visit [John Elm Lab's Writeup](https://johnelmlabs.com/posts/magic-link-auth/) for more info.

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
